                          <p class="card-text">Shoja lies 5 km before Jalori Pass, on the alternative route that connects Shimla with Kullu valley. Unblemished by the spots of commercialisation, Shoja is a perfect hamlet to relax and soak in the fresh mountain air. Located in the Seraj Valley, Serloskar Lake is a famous attraction here, known for its picture-perfect sunset. At a short distance, lies a natural waterfall, where you can take a chilling bath or just laze around under the sun while savouring a drink.</p>

                          <p class="card-text">Malana is a small village, sleeping peacefully in the Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh. The most intriguing fact about this hidden gem is that its residents believe themselves to be the direct descendants of Alexander the Great. The place has its own set administrative laws and practices that closely resemble that of the Greek administrative system. The glorious Chandrakhani and Deotibba peaks stand over the village protecting it from the outside world.</p>
